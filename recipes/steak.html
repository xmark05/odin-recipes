     <h1> avocado, steak, and fried eggs recipe</h1>

     <h2> Description </h2>
     <p> This hearty and flavorful dish brings together tender slices of perfectly grilled steak, creamy avocado, and a golden, sunny-side-up fried egg.
         The steak is seasoned with a blend of spices and seared to perfection, creating a juicy and savory base. Itâ€™s paired with fresh avocado, 
         which adds a creamy texture and mild, nutty flavor. The crowning glory is a runny fried egg, with its rich yolk cascading over the steak and 
         avocado, adding a delicious, velvety finish. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a protein-packed dinner, this dish is as satisfying as it is 
         delicious.
