        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> Smashed Burgers are a simple yet delicious way to enjoy a classic burger. Ground beef is pressed thinly onto 
            a hot skillet, creating a crispy, caramelized crust while staying juicy inside. Topped with melted cheese and 
            served on a toasted bun with your favorite toppings, these burgers are quick to make and packed with flavor.
